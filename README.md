# Guess The Number Game

Guess The Number Game created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Project was inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's course on modern JS where he creates the same project. Followed along for his HTML and CSS setup but changed a lot of other features and introuced more advanced concepts.

Implemented all of the javascript using my own logic so it was different than his. Used DOM manipulation to have javascript change all inputs on the front end. Introuced some CSS animations. Used local storage so if a user comes back their prior high score is stillthere.

Project really helped in solidifying a lot of javascript concepts.
