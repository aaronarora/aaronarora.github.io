# Guess The Number Game

Guess The Number Game created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Project was inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's course on modern JS where he creates the same project.

Followed alongside his code but revamped a lot of other parts. Used DOM manipulation to have javascript change all inputs on the front end. Introuced some CSS animations. Used local storage so if a user comes back their prior high score is there.

Project really helped in solidifying a lot of javascript concepts.
